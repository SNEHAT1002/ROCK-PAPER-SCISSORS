In this article, I’ll walk you through how to make a rock, paper, and scissors game with Python. In the rock, paper and scissors game our goal is to create a command-line game where a user has the option to choose between rock, paper and scissors and if the user wins the score is added, and at the end when the user finishes the game, the score is shown to the user.


 
Rock, Paper and Scissors Game with Python
To create the Rock, Paper and Scissors game with Python, we need to take the user’s choice and then we need to compare it with the computer choice which is taken using the random module in Python from a list of choices, and if the user wins then the score will increase by 1:

import random
choices = ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]
computer = random.choice(choices)
player = False
cpu_score = 0
player_score = 0
while True:
    player = input("Rock, Paper or  Scissors?").capitalize()
    ## Conditions of Rock,Paper and Scissors
    if player == computer:
        print("Tie!")
    elif player == "Rock":
        if computer == "Paper":
            print("You lose!", computer, "covers", player)
            cpu_score+=1
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "smashes", computer)
            player_score+=1
    elif player == "Paper":
        if computer == "Scissors":
            print("You lose!", computer, "cut", player)
            cpu_score+=1
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "covers", computer)
            player_score+=1
    elif player == "Scissors":
        if computer == "Rock":
            print("You lose...", computer, "smashes", player)
            cpu_score+=1
        else:
            print("You win!", player, "cut", computer)
            player_score+=1
    elif player=='End':
        print("Final Scores:")
        print(f"CPU:{cpu_score}")
        print(f"Plaer:{player_score}")
        break
